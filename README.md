# Energy Predication  Module Using ML algorithm
 
In my project, Energy Prediction Module Using ML Algorithm, I developed a web application utilizing Python for the backend and machine learning algorithms for energy prediction. The backend framework is built using Flask, which efficiently handles routing and API functionalities. For the frontend, I designed a user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS to ensure accessibility and visual appeal.
